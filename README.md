# Ori WotW Save Manager
### Installation
Installation is pretty simple. Place the executable in your desired folder and then run it to create the save file directory.
### Usage
*Currently this program will only check your first save slot (saveFile0.uberstate).*

When you have your desired save, click the **Import Save** button and enter your desired name. Save file list auto sorts alphabetically.

When you wish to load a save file, select one from the list and click the **Load Save** button. Alternatively, you can select a file and then hit your **F9** key. This is a global hotkey so you can even press it when another program is in focus.

You can rename or delete a selected save file by right clicking and selecting an option in the context menu. You can also hit the respective key as labeled in the context menu (**F2** & **Delete**).

You can also toggle Ori's debug mode on and off.  
*You will need to restart the game for this change to take effect.*
